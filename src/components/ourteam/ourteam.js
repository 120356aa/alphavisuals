                        <h2>Bryan</h2>
                        <p>My name is Bryan loop. I grew up in Portland Oregon. I started 
                            doing photography back in 2009 when I was in high school. From 
                            there I graduated in 2011 from Benson Polytechnic. I never thought 
                            that I would keep doing photography from that point because I came 
                            from a low income house hold that could not afford equipment ...
                            <span className="hidden">
                                I finally was able to buy my own camera in 2015 it was a cheap Nikon 
                                d5300 which was great at the time.
                                I had that until I was asked to start doing weddings as a secondary 
                                shooter in 2018 which is when I got the camera I am using now a Nikon 
                                D750. I would describe my photography to be clean and creative. I am 
                                quick to adapt to lighting. Coming from a dance background I would say 
                                I am pretty creative. With all that I have learned I will let my work 
                                say the rest! I look forward to getting to know you now!‚Äù
